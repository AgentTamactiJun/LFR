# Robolution Readme 2019
## Introduction
This repository contains the code for the Robolution competition 2019. The competition is organized by the RoboCup@Work league and will take place at the RoboCup German Open 2019 in Magdeburg. The goal of the competition is to develop a robot system that can autonomously perform a pick-and-place task in a warehouse environment. The robot system consists of a mobile robot and a robotic arm. The mobile robot is equipped with a 2D laser scanner and a camera. The robotic arm is a Franka Emika Panda robot. The robot system is controlled by a ROS-based software system. The software system is divided into several ROS packages, each of which is responsible for a specific aspect of the robot system. The software system is implemented in Python and C++.
